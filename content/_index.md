# About me
I am a descriptive and historical linguist with a heavy computational bend.
During my PhD, I have specialized on [Cariban](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/cari1283) languages, but I am interested in a wide range of human languages their structural aspects, from phonetic details to diachronic morphosyntax.
My weapons of choice for linguistic data wrangling are python and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).
Most of the work I do is centered on "low-resource" languages.
For modeling linguistic data, I am particularly fond of (and proficient in) the [CLDF](https://cldf.clld.org/)/[CLLD](https://clld.org/) framework.
I also have experience as a full-stack web developer, using Django or Flask for the server, and vanilla JS / jQuery / Vue for the frontend.
I am fond of maps; two examples of my work are a python library for [projecting family trees onto maps](https://lingtreemaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html), and the interactive map of German-speaking Switzerland in the [Swiss German Dialect Corpus](https://chmk.ch/de/).
