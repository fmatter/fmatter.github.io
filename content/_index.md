# About me
I have a background in descriptive and historical linguistics, but have developed a heavy computational bend.
Despite having somewhat specialized on [Cariban](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/cari1283) languages, I am fundamentally interested in all human languages and their structural aspects, from phonetic details to diachronic morphosyntax.
I mostly work with "low-resource" languages, for which no large amounts of data or trained models are available.
In my post-doc project I focused on creating a framework for writing [digital grammars](/digital-grammars).

Most of the work I do can be given the label of **scientific programming**; my weapon of choice for linguistic data wrangling is python, often using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).
I am well-versed in the [CLDF](https://cldf.clld.org/)/[CLLD](https://clld.org/) framework (see my [components for typical descriptive data](/cldf-ldd/)), and have experience with [TEI](https://www.tei-c.org/).
I have also built comparative databases, morphological parsers, transliteration systems, and tools for "lifting" legacy data.

I also have experience as a full-stack web developer, mostly using Django and Bootstrap.
Currently I am creating the [next version of the TITUS database](https://titus2.uni-frankfurt.de/).
A particular interest of mine are maps; two examples of my work are the interactive map of German-speaking Switzerland in the [Swiss German Dialect Corpus](https://chmk.ch/de/), and a python library for [projecting family trees onto maps](https://lingtreemaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html).
