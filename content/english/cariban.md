# Cariban Languages Research

The [Cariban](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/cari1283) language family is a group of South American languages spoken primarily in northern South America, especially in Venezuela, Brazil, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. My work with these languages spans documentation, analysis, and the development of digital resources.

## Cariban Database

The [Cariban Database](https://cariban.clld.org/) is a comprehensive collection of linguistic data on Cariban languages, structured as a [Cross-Linguistic Data Format (CLDF)](https://cldf.clld.org/) dataset and served through a [Cross-Linguistic Linked Data (CLLD)](https://clld.org/) web application.

## Phylogenetic Classification

I've explored quantitative methods for analyzing the internal classification of the Cariban family. My approach combines traditional historical linguistic methods with computational phylogenetic analysis.

## Yawarana Documentation

As part of my research, I've worked with Yawarana, a Cariban language spoken in Venezuela. This includes the development of a digital sketch grammar:

- [Yawarana Digital Sketch Grammar](https://yawarana-sketch.herokuapp.com/)
- [Yawarana Corpus (CLDF)](https://github.com/caribank/yawarana-corpus-cldf)

## Comparative Studies

My comparative work on Cariban languages includes:

### Verbal Person Marking
An examination of the complex verbal person marking systems across the family, including hierarchical alignment patterns and the historical development of these systems.

### Morphosyntactic Evolution
Analysis of how various grammatical subsystems have evolved within the family, with particular attention to verbal morphology and alignment.

### "Split Third Person" Systems
Investigation of specialized third person marking patterns in languages like Arara, documented in my paper ["The origin of split third person marking in Arara (Cariban)"](http://www.etnolinguistica.org/article:vol8n2-1).

## Resources and Tools

I've developed several resources specifically for work with Cariban languages:

- Morphological parsers for select languages
- Specialized corpus annotation schemes
- Data conversion tools for legacy materials
