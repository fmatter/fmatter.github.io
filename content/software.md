I mostly code in Python; here's some of the software I've developed:

* [pylingdocs](www.fl.mt/pylingdocs): write data-rich linguistics documents. You can integrate data from CLDF datasets, and output to a variety of formats.
    * there's a [GUI](https://github.com/fmatter/pylingdocs-gui), too
* [pyradigms](https://github.com/fmatter/pyradigms): compose and decompose linguistic paradigms; basically pivot tables for linguistics.
* [lingtreemaps](https://github.com/fmatter/lingtreemaps): plot data on linguistic trees **and** maps.
* the [unboxer](https://github.com/fmatter/unboxer): extract data from [shoebox](https://software.sil.org/shoebox/) and [toolbox](https://software.sil.org/toolbox/) projects to [CLDF](https://cldf.clld.org/)-ready CSV files. 
* [cldflex](https://github.com/fmatter/cldflex): convert [FLEx](https://software.sil.org/fieldworks/) data to [CLDF](https://cldf.clld.org/)-ready CSV files.
* [pylacoan](https://github.com/fmatter/pylacoan): simple fieldwork-oriented corpus annotation.
* [expex-acro](https://ctan.org/pkg/expex-acro): glossing abbreviations and useful linguistic markup commands for LaTeX
* [biblatex2bibtex](https://github.com/fmatter/biblatex2bibtex): convert biblatex files to bibtex.
* [humidifier](https://github.com/fmatter/humidifier): create human-friendly IDs from strings.
